node writingAssistant.js
```

This command will initiate the Writing Assistant, and you'll be prompted to interact with it through your command line interface.

### Interacting with the Bot

Once the Writing Assistant is running, you can interact with it using the following process:

1. **Input Prompts**: 
   The Writing Assistant will ask for input via command line prompts. Provide clear instructions for what type of content you need. For example, you can type "Write an introduction for a blog post about AI in healthcare."

2. **Receiving Content**: 
   After processing your input, the Writing Assistant will generate the content and display it in the command line interface. Review the content to ensure it meets your requirements.
